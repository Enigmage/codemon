# Codemon 
### A CLI tool to ace Competitive Programming Contests.

Most of the time of a competitive programmer is wasted in compiling, adding inputs, 
and debugging. Typing commands again and again wastes time, which we cannot afford 
during a contest. 

Dont worry about creating files, directories during contests.
Simply type `commands init <ContestName>` and automatically get a new directory set
up and all files created for each problem. This tool was created specifically for 
Codeforces Contests, so 6 files `A-F.cpp` are created.
