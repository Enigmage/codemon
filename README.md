# Codemon 
### A CLI tool to ace Competitive Programming Contests.

Most of the time of a competitive programmer is wasted in compiling, adding inputs, 
and debugging. Typing commands again and again wastes time, which we cannot afford 
during a contest. 

### How to install ?
- Type `git clone https://github.com/ankingcodes/codemon.git` to clone the package
- Install the package locally using `pip install .`
  This command will place `codemon` executable at `/usr/local/bin` so that it can 
  be executed anywhere.

## CLI - commands
   ```
   codemon init <contestName>
   ```
    
  This creates a directory with the name of the contest and creates 6 `.cpp` files 
  as per contests in CodeForces.

  ```
  codemon listen <fileName>
  ```

  This is a WIP.
